Summary: Medical Entity Recognizer on Spanish Medical Texts.

The tool we present has the following novel aspects:
 -High precision and coverage, close to 85%, for medical entities of the type: illness or symptom, medication, part of the body (or location) and modifiers (severe, mild, type II, ...).
 -Speed, allowing to analyze thousands of words and documents in a short time.
 -Simplicity, by not requiring any type of dictionary. It only takes as input the original text and obtains as output the text annotated with medical entities.

The tool is the result of numerous research works that have been presented and accepted in internationally prestigeous journals and conferences:

This tools allows to recognize entities of the medical domain in a document. More precisely, 4 types of entities corresponding to:
 -Drugs and substances, for example Clamoxyl, penicillin, ...
 -Diseases and symptoms, such as "myocardial infarction", "headache", ...
 -Anatomical elements (associated with diseases): "pulmonary", "lower extremities", ...
 -Qualifiers (associated with diseases): "severe", "mild", "type III", ...

The system is based on a supervised statistical algorithm, which has been learned from a large set of medical texts written down by hospital experts.



You can use the tool to analyze a document as follows:
